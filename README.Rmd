The aim of the ActDev project is to provide evidence on active travel provision and potential in and around planned and proposed development sites.

It builds on the ACTON project.
See the [vignette in the acton website](https://cyipt.github.io/acton/articles/the-actdev-project.html) for a high-level overview.

See the issue tracker for discussion. Contributions of ideas/issues/code welcome.

If you would like to add a new site, open an issue on the issue tracker and check out our guide on adding new sites [here](https://github.com/cyipt/actdev/blob/main/code/tests/add-new-site.md) (requires R/RStudio, we can help with this).
