## The problem

--

- Few tools exist for assessing active travel potential or provision in/around new developments

--

- Planning and transport intersections are not always joined up

--

- The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

## The ActDev tool

4 month UKRI funded project on high impact research in transport/planning

Publicly available tool providing evidence on active travel provision and potential in and around planned and proposed development sites

## Methodology

**Open source tools and data** is central to the methodology. The following data sources and tools were used:

- Planning data (PlanIT)
- Demographic and travel data (2011 Census & ONS)
- Journey routing and road characteristics (OSM, OSRM & MHCLG)
- Mode shift scenarios (PCT)
- In-site metrics (OSRM)
- Visualisation (Mapbox & AB Street)

## Spatial variation of sites

## Research findings

- Median distance to town centre is 3.2 km only three within 2.0 km
- **14%** of trips made by active travel around 35 sample site locations compared with **14% nationwide**
- Provision of good infrastructure varies considerably

## The importance of open data and open tools

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-open-2020/featured.png)
- Transport models have a huge impact on transport planning
- More people with access to good data -> better outcomes
- New paper, Lovelace et al (2020) describes the emergence and possibilities for 'open access models'
