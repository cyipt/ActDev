The aim of the ActDev project is to provide evidence on active travel
provision and potential in and around planned and proposed development
sites.

It builds on the ACTON project. See the [vignette in the acton
website](https://cyipt.github.io/acton/articles/the-actdev-project.html)
for a high-level overview.

See the issue tracker for discussion. Contributions of ideas/issues/code
welcome.
