# Overview of the tool

The ActDev tool is a prototype tool to help the planning system better
account for and support sustainable travel. The aim is to demonstrate
what is possible with new datasets and methods and to make the case for
a complete nationally available tool.

Currently the tool only provides data for 35 sites, as outlined in the
[ActDev report](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/report/). This manual
describes the functionality of the toolâ€™s main layers: the landing page
at <https://actdev.cyipt.bike>, the site level web application which is
available at
[actdev.cyipt.bike/great-kneighton/](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/great-kneighton/),
and the A/B Street traffic simulation tool.
