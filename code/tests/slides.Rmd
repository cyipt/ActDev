## The problem

--

- Transport models were designed to support growth in car ownership and reduce journey times (Boyce and Williams, 2015)

--

- 21^st^ Century priorities are very different

--

  - Climate science, air pollution and health force a shift in focus
  - The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

## The solution

**New technologies mean that open access transport models are possible**

## The paper

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-open-2020/featured_hu0c285bfa775f060af938f28c962ce470_79909_808x455_fill_lanczos_smart1_2.png)
- Transport models represent a leverage point in transport systems
- New paper, Lovelace et al (2020) describes the emergence and possibilities for 'open access models'

## Live demo

# Get involved

- Support open source solutions indirectly
  - Sign-up to platforms for sharing and collaborating on open source projects, such as https://github.com/
  - Preferentially use, cite and endorse open access and open source solutions
  - Find the open source tool best suited to your needs and communicate constructively with the developers
  - Communicate ways to improve open source solutions, e.g. by commenting on 'issue trackers' on forums such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- Download, install and play with open source software
  - R/RStudio, great for data analysis but also interactive visualisation and, increasingly, [transport planning workflows](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/)
  - Have a play with open access transport tools such as [A/B Street](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/#ab-street) and the [PCT](https://www.pct.bike/), which can run on your computer or in the browser
