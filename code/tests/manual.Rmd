# Overview of the tool

The ActDev tool is a prototype tool to help the planning system better account for and support sustainable travel.
The aim is to demonstrate what is possible with new datasets and methods and to make the case for a complete nationally available tool.

Currently the tool only provides data for 35 sites, as outlined in the [ActDev report](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/report/).
This manual describes the functionality of the tool's main layers: the landing page at https://actdev.cyipt.bike, the site level web application which is available at [actdev.cyipt.bike/great-kneighton/](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/great-kneighton/), and the A/B Street traffic simulation tool.

### Desire lines

The desire lines layer shows the shortest path between origins on the site and destinations.
The layer can be selected by clicking on the 'Desire lines' toggle in the left panel.

The purpose of the layer is to highlight the kind of trips people who live on the site may want to make.
Currently the desire lines only include 2 types of trip:

- Commuting trips from the 2011 Census
- Trips to the nearest town

In future work we plan to increase the number of trip types represented in the desire line and other travel layers.
The other travel layers, which are based on the desire lines, are the Routes and Route network layers.
