# Aim: calculate in-site metrics

# Question: should we base this on OSM data or routing data?
# It's quicker and less resource intensive to calculate 
# these metrics using a simple routing approach, reducing
# the computational requirements associated with bulk
# import and processing of OSM, although that 2nd 
# approach allows more detailed info to be extracted


# Approach1: quicker and easier -------------------------------------------



# Approach 2: use data from osmextract ------------------------------------
