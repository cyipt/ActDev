# Introduction

bringing together 4 datasets

## The need for the tool

Two key challenges - sustainable transport and housing crisis.

Human health, decarbonisation, air pollution and the need to increase walking and cycling.

Need for affordable housing
Terrible state of new homes in England
TfNH reports
Moving in the wrong direction, towards car dependency.

## Policy landscape

White paper
Gear change and LTN1/20
Housing algorithm thrown out
5 year housing land supply and the Call For Sites process
Site sustainability assessments

## Aims and objectives

We aimed to create a tool which:

a) Provides a rating for the level of active travel provision (cycling and walking) between development sites and key services, to determine whether a location would be or is acceptable from health perspectives.

b) For known planned/existing development sites, the tool will provide additional analysis to inform specific improvements that could be made in active travel provision and proximity of key services within walking and cycling distance.

c) makes the case for further work to create an interactive web application (including the underlying evolving evidence base) to do the above but on a national scale.

## Access to local services

When choosing a development site, a key consideration is proximity to local services such as shops, schools, parks, and other community facilities.
Nationally, access to a range of services has been quantified through the Department for Transport's Journey Time Statistics(link). 
These record the average journey times to the closest food store, primary school, secondary school, further education college, pharmacy, GP surgery, hospital, and town centre, at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.
These LSOA level averages are derived from the mean of the journey times from each Output Area within the LSOA.

Journey times are computed by three modes.
The first mode uses a combination of walking and public transport, depending on which of these is fastest.
The second mode is cycling, and the third is driving.
Using these statistics, we can get a picture of which locations allow easy access to local services by walking and cycling.
We can also compare these journey times to journey times by car.

The JTS data does have some limitations. 
There is no information on the quality of the route.
For example, a fast cycling route may be possible along a busy road, but in practice this might not be a feasible route for most people.
Similarly, we cannot differentiate between a well-used high frequency bus service and an expensive, occasional service.

A further limitation is that the JTS data comprises LSOA-level averages, so will not necessarily be representative of a given locality within that LSOA. 
To get data that better matches a particular development site, we have also written code to abstract chosen points of interest from OpenStreetMap (OSM).
For example, we can identify all of the supermarkets on OSM that are close to a given site, and calculate journey times from the site to these known destinations. 

Town centres are a key destination, visited for a wide range of purposes such as shopping, leisure, entertainment, employment, personal business and to access onward travel.
Using the same 2004 town centre dataset as is used in the JTS statistics, we can identify the closest town centre to a given site. 

Travel to work is one of the most frequent journey purposes. 
We have high degree of knowledge of employment locations through the use of census data, as described in the following section. 

## Demographic and travel data

Travel to work comprises x% of total travel (ref).
These journeys form the core of our investigation, because, unlike most other journey types, the origins and destinations are comprehensively understood and recorded, with complete national coverage, in the 2011 Census (ref).
We used commute data which disaggregates the points of origin and destination as OD pairs at the Medium Super Output Area (MSOA) level.
As well as the geographic location of origin and destination we can also determine the journey distance, and crucially, information is available on the mode of travel.
Thus we can estimate the average distance of travel to work, and the proportions of residents who commute by walking, cycling, driving, or other modes.

The latest census was conducted in 2011.
Some of our case study sites were already partially complete by that date, meaning the MSOA data reflects, in part, the actual journeys of site residents themselves.
However, in most cases the census data is best seen as an indication of travel patterns in the local area surrounding a site, rather than a reflection of the site itself.

An MSOA can cover a wide area, especially in rural areas. 

Issues with the stats and mode share can arise from this (eg Wynyard; Cambridge - Great Kneighton v Trumpington Meadows)

We chose to focus on three modes of travel - walking, cycling and car/van driving.
Walking and cycling represent active travel.
Car/van driving is the most frequent mode of travel across the UK, and one of the most damaging in environmental and health terms.
A key policy aim is to replace journeys by car/van with walking or cycling.

## Journey routing and road characteristics

Having obtained data on commuter destinations and modes of travel, the next step is to identify the routes on the local road network that we expect these journeys to follow.
We generated cycling and walking routes for the journeys to walk.
We also combined the individual routes into a series of route networks. 

For cycle journeys to work, we use a set of algorithms created by CycleStreets.net(link).
Three algorithms are available, representing fast, balanced and quiet routes.
For the fast routes, journey times are minimised.
For the quiet routes, a 'quietness' parameter is maximised, to avoid routes that follow busy roads.
The balanced routes represent an intermediate between the fast and quiet approaches.  
Factors assessed during the routing include road type, cycle path width and surface quality, barriers and obstructions, signage and route legibility, among others (https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/v1/journey/).
The gradient of route segments is also taken into account.

It is useful to have these three different versions of the cycle routes, because this can reveal places where for example a direct road may link to a destination, but may be too busy for most people to consider cycling along it.
If the 'quiet route' to a given destination is considerably longer than the 'fast route', it suggests that the introduction of dedicated cycle infrastructure along the line of the fast route would likely help to improve cycle accessibility.

For journeys to work on foot, we used the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) routing engine.....

The generation of the routes allows estimation of parameters such as route length, duration, mean busyness, maximum busyness, mean gradient and maximum gradient. 
The next step is to combine the routes into a route network.
We produced separate route networks for walking routes, fast cycle routes, balanced cycle routes, and quiet cycle routes.
With these we can see the total number of journeys on each road segment, which can be analysed alongside segment level data on road busyness and gradient.

## Mode shift scenarios

For each site, we generated two scenarios, Baseline and Go Active.
The 2011 Census journey to work data represents baseline conditions. 
For the Baseline scenario, we simply adjusted this data to represent the population, at completion, of the chosen residential development site, rather than the population of the MSOA(s) that the site lies within.
For any given OD pair and mode: 
Baseline trips = 2011 Census trips from local MSOA(s) / 2011 MSOA population(s) * Number of dwellings at completion * Mean household size
The data for MSOA population(s) and mean household size both represent total population, rather than population of working age.

The Go Active scenario represents the potential for increased uptake of walking and cycling, in the presence of high quality infrastructure and sustained investment.
We calculated this increased uptake purely in terms of a switch from car/van driving to walking or cycling.
Other modes of travel such as bus and rail were kept constant, and no change was made to journeys that already took place by foot or bicycle in the Baseline scenario.
We also assumed that the journey destinations and the total volume of travel remains the same as in the Baseline scenario.

To generate the increased cycle uptake in Go Active, we used the 'Go Dutch' cycling uptake function from the Propensity to Cycle Tool (ref). 
This represents the proportion of journeys that would be undertaken by bicycle if cycle mode share corresponded with average cycling levels in the Netherlands.
This function controls for route length and hilliness.

To generate the increased walking uptake in Go Active, we used a set of simple estimations.
For journeys <= 2.0 km in length we assumed a walking mode share 30% above baseline levels; for journeys of 2.0 - 2.5 km length, walking mode share was increased by 20%; for 2.5 - 3.0 km by 10%; and for 3.0 - 6.0 km by 5%.
*check how this works*
This is not data-driven but is simply an estimation. 

## Within-site metrics

The measures discussed so far relate to journeys to work or to other destinations.
The majority of the length of these journeys will take place outside the boundaries of any particular new residential development.
However we also wanted to investigate the internal layout of the sites themselves.
In particular, the circuity of routes within a site can reveal features relating to the design of the site.
The comparative circuity of routes by foot, by bicycle and by car can be assessed.

To do this, we generated cycling, walking and driving routes for a set of journeys between 20 random points within each site.
We routed these journeys using OSRM.
Having obtained the sets of random points, we first generated the driving journeys, then reset the exact origin and destination points based on the results of this routing.
This constrained the points to be on the road network itself, preventing cycle and walking route origins and destinations from spawning on footpaths.
